# 4fours
this is a GitHub repo containing the programs used for my project work group in 2022's mathematical calculations. all of these programs have been adopted from code by user [Radcliffe](https://github.com/Radcliffe), specifically [four-fours.py](https://gist.github.com/Radcliffe/fab1cefe6e2a3a23466539a7ecbc6edb).

as of august 5, 2022, here is the list of all files in the repository:
1. [set1.py](https://github.com/shuu-wasseo/4fours/set1/set1.py). this utilises all BODMAS operations.
2. [set1s.py](https://github.com/shuu-wasseo/4fours/set1/set1s.py). this allows the user to do the same as with [set1.py](https://github.com/shuu-wasseo/4fours/set1/set1.py) but also choose which operations to include.
3. [set2.py](https://github.com/shuu-wasseo/4fours/set2.py). this utilises all BODMAS operations (as seen in set 1), as well as floor, ceiling, factorial and square root (not exploited completely due to computational limitations).
